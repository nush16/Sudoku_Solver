# Sudoku Calculator

## **Project Description**

I have developed the Sudoku Calculator, a graphical application using Pygame, a popular Python library for creating games and multimedia applications. My project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for solving Sudoku puzzles and generating new ones. With the help of Pygame's interactive features, my application allows users to play Sudoku and test their problem-solving skills.
